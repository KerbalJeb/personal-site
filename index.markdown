      excerpt: "Iâ€™m currently pursuing my BEng in Electrical Engineering at the University of Victoria. I like to start a variety of personal MCU based electronics and programming projects in my free time. I also enjoy working on some laser cutting and 3D printing projects at my local makerspace . Some of my less technical interests include gaming and SciFi books/shows. Some of my favourite games include games such as Kerbal Space Program and Stellaris. The Expanse, Bobiverse and Star Trek are some of my favourite SciFi franchise."
